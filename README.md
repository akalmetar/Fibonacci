# Fibonacci

Fibonacci series is a series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. 
The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.

This project is Comsole Application to calculate the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence. 
This calculation can be done by writing just few lines of code in seperate function, but this project 
Also implements Factory and Singleton Pattern.

The purpose of the implementing pattern is to decouple / abstract the logic and concrete classes from the client code.
